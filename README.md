## About Me

I aspire to bring a positive change in the world around us: through technology and innovation. I am a tech enthusiast, and over the past five years, I have been on a journey to get nearer to my goal of using technology for the benefit of others. Through self and guided learning of tech, I am now proficient in JavaScript, Python, Java and several web development frameworks (including React JS and Django).

And now, even deeper in my journey of learning tech but firmly still with the same mindset, I want to use my skills and experience in technology to create software that reflects my mission and has a valuable impact on the world.
